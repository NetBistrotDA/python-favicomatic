  python favicons
</h1>

This script is based on the <a href="https://favicomatic.com/">FAVIC-O-MATIC</a> that we have been using on every project for a few years.

The web app is just fine but, anyway, here is an option.

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/NetBistrotDA/python-favicomatic

```

Replace the icon.png for a square image of at least 310x310px.

Install the PIP library

```
pip install PIL
```
then:

```
python favicon-gen.py
```
